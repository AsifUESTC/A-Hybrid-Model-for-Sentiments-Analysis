# IMDb Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a machine learning model for sentiment analysis using the IMDb dataset. The project focuses on classifying movie reviews as positive or negative based on their text content.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the IMDb website and consists of 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive or negative. It serves as a standard benchmark for sentiment analysis tasks.

## Project Overview

This project involves the following steps:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the text data, including tokenization, removing stop words, and vectorization using methods like TF-IDF.
- **Model Development:** Building a machine learning model using algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM) using ensemble learning (hybrid approach).
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tuning the model's hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.
